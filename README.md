# Malaria Cell Classification Application

Welcome to the **Malaria Cell Classification Application** repository! This project includes a **React** frontend and a **Flask** backend, containerized using **Docker** and deployed on **Google Cloud Container Instances**. The application uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to classify blood cell images as **Parasitized** (infected) or **Uninfected**.

## About the Author

Hello! I'm **Avi**, a software engineer passionate about solving real-world challenges using technology and machine learning. This application is part of my capstone project for the MIT Applied Data Science and Machine Learning program, where I worked on detecting malaria from blood cell images using deep learning models.

### Background

- **Education:**
  - Mechanical Engineering Major, Computer Science Minor – University of British Columbia
  - XR/VR Software Development Course – CircuitStream (University of Toronto)
  - Currently enrolled in MIT’s Professional Education Data Science and Machine Learning Program
  
- **Experience:**
  - I work as a software engineer at CN Rail, primarily with C#, ASP.NET, MVC applications, and machine learning technologies. I’ve also developed and launched a VR game called **Crazy Golf VR** on the Meta App Lab, which now has over 11,000 installs.

- **Interests:**
  - Machine Learning, Deep Learning, XR/VR, Software Development, Healthcare Technology

### Motivation

Malaria is a serious health problem in many regions, and early, accurate diagnosis can save lives. This project aims to bring machine learning into healthcare by making it easier and faster to detect malaria in blood cells using image classification, potentially supporting healthcare workers in resource-constrained settings.
